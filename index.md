This blog has been established with the express purpose of discussing the various ways in which
parents can make the online environment for their children safer.

After discussing how I have addressed this issue with my own family with other parents, I have always been greeted with
words of encouragement and a desire from parents to be in a position to be able to emulate this.

With this blog I want to share my knowledge with others so that they too can implement changes that make
a real difference. I have spent a lot of time working out how to accomplish this and this blog will allow me to convey this to anyone that might be struggling with knowing how to tackle this very real problem that nearly every parent is facing.
   1. How to limit time per device per day?
   2. How to filter content on each device?
   3. What hardware and software is required.
   4. How do I set this hardware and software to achieve these objects.
   5. Other options.... and whatever else comes to mind.
